  <h1>Anime</h1>

<p>Anime has always been something that i can turn to when i need to chill. I watch it because it keeps me entertained. There is always something to enjoy, whether it is deep stories, crazy action scenes, and emotional character development. Its an escape from reality and I love that!</p>

<h2>My Top 3 Favorites</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Bleach</li>
  <li>Black Clover</li>
  <li>Demon Slayer</li>
</ol>

<p>I also love how each anime has a lesson behind it such as teamwork, never giving up, chasing their goals or just being their true self. It reminds me to always push forward in life no matter what.</p>
